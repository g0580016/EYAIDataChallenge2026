title: "Can AI and data actually help us build a more sustainable future?"
---

The problems we’re facing—climate change, shrinking resources, and environmental damage—are huge.  
But there’s a silver lining: satellite data, coding, and AI give us tools to make real change.

Pair that with creative, driven people tackling challenges on a global stage, and suddenly the impossible starts to feel possible.

The EY AI & Data Challenge is a perfect example of this in action.  
Every year, students and early-career professionals from all over the world dive into real-world problems, applying coding, AI, and data science to make a difference.

Speaking from experience as a winner of a previous edition focused on rice crops, I can say this isn’t just about winning a prize.  
The challenge pushed me to level up my skills, tackle complex datasets, and collaborate with brilliant minds I wouldn’t have met otherwise.
